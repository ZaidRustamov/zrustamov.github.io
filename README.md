Hey, I'm Zaid Rustamov! ✌
I have been studying at ADA University in Computer Science major. I'm from Lerik, Azerbaijan.

Since 2019, I studies in that university. My lovely courses coincides with my major cores; Programming Principle ll (JAVA), Data Structure and Algorithms, Linear Algebra, Digital Logic Design, Computer Organization & Architecture, and Software Engineering. 👩‍💻😊

"Design is not just what is looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." Steve Jobs

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time ⌛ when Barcelona plays footbal ⚽, reading books 📚, and specially designing something 👩‍💻.

What I'm focusing on 🙂
Currently improving my JAVA, HTML, CSS and JS skills.
BTW, if you're looking for my personal webpage, take a look at this github.io.zaid.
